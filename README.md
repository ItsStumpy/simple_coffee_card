# coffee_card

A super simple, but absolutely amazing, coffee card made with Flutter.

## The Good Bits

Confused about where the `src` stuff is? Don't you worry, it's all in the `lib` folder.

- In there, you will find a `statefulWidget`: If coming from `React` that means it is a `dynamic component that handles updating state with a user action`.
- You will also find a couple of `widgets or components` if that's what you're familiar with: `styled_body_text` & `styled_button`.

If you are confused, that's ok! I was too until I actually wrote some code. So get to reading scoundrel! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ“–
